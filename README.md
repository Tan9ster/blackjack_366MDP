Copyright by Daniel James Phan 2014

This is a MDP of BlackJack written for CMPUT 366 in python.
The programs require matlibplot and numpy to work properly.

Provided by the class is the blackjack.py and the inital framework for randomPolicy.py (however as part of the assignment, the calculations were implmented by me).
